# hcml_factcheck

## Goal
  - Research question: Does the exposure to fact-checks affect users' behaviors on Twitter? (e.g., cross-ideological information consumption)
    - Definition of exposure: Getting replies containing fact-checks
  - Employing causal inference methods (e.g., interrupted time series, delayed feedback, fixed-effects, regression discontinuity)

## Code
  - `exposed_tweet_collector.ipynb`: Collect pairs of tweets (original exposed tweets & replies containing politifact articles)
  - `effect_data_collector.ipynb`: Collect tweets (i.e., behaviors) posted before and after the exposure 

## Data
  - Data repository: https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1HoWUz6IeeVXXYTSXaZ8dyLiD4C6Kt0Tu?usp=sharing
    - Data generated by `exposed_tweet_collector.ipynb`
      - `exposed_tweet.csv`: Collected pairs of tweets (original tweets & replies containing politifact articles)
      - `users_data.json`: User information (suspended users are missing)
      - `original_tweets.json`: Original tweet information

## Methodological issues
  - Selection bias: about 25\% of users who posted original tweets are suspended. thus, we cannot retrieve their tweets
    - confounding factors may be related to both exposure to fact-checks and user suspension
    - use more recent data to minimize suspended users?
